## Test 0
This test subscribes a new player to the game, it tries to select an already chosen character and input is asked again. Then the ranking is shown and a tick is executed to show that if no input is entered from any character, nothing happens.

## Test 1
This test is a complete demo of the capabilities of the vehicles and characters. It shows their acceleration, turning and braking powers as well as the insertion of new characters to the game.

## Test 2
This test shows that the distance increment changes when the vehicle reaches a different terrain. Note that the velocity display doesn't change (due to testing reasons), that's the base velocity without adaptors.

## Test 3
This test is a demo that shows that a vehicle can go back by an angle increment.
